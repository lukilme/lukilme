## Skills???
</div>

I appreciate how people are often aware of their own abilities, even if they sometimes exaggerate them a bit—it's quite amusing!

<div align="center">

### Data Science
</div>

Personally, I like data science because I like graphs. There's something magical about turning numbers into colorful shapes, maybe because I have some neurodiversity disorder.

- Pandas: Used to manage DataFrames and Series, helping you extract valuable insights from your data. Sometimes I get a SQL vibe, but with fewer joins.

- NumPy: Essential for performing operations on matrices and arrays. Basically, it’s like a math academy: your data is toned and tweaked — effortlessly (for you, at least).

- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost: Powerful libraries for implementing machine learning algorithms. I love watching the training logs roll by, pretending it’s a sci-fi movie and I’m hacking some secret system. __“Improve! Improve!, my child.”__

- Matplotlib: The ultimate graphing tool that helps me pretend I’m an artist. It lets you turn numbers into beautiful pictures. Picasso? More like NumPy-casso! ~~Why don’t I have any friends?~~

- SymPy: It deals with symbolic math. You know, for when you need to flex that algebra muscle and say, "I don't want approximations, I want the exact value of pi as a fraction of infinity."

- SciPy: Think of SciPy as NumPy's super-gifted sibling that really likes calculus and solving differential equations and is possibly a virgin. If you need integrals, optimizations, or physics simulations, SciPy is your choice — because someone has to do the hard math, and it's not going to be me.

### Frontend
</div>

- Vue: Versatile and my go-to when I need something fast and efficient.

- Angular: The main framework I use. Angular is like that well-organized friend who loves structure and rules — sometimes overwhelming, but you know everything will fall into place. Plus, it’s perfect when you want your app to feel like you’re running a tight ship.

- React: Sometimes a little confusing. It’s like assembling furniture without the manual: the components are all there, but somehow I always end up wondering if I missed a step. Where does that hook go again?

- WebAssembly: Pain and suffering. It’s like voluntarily entering a world where everything is fast, but at the cost of your sanity. It’s powerful, but working with it feels like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing and the instructions written in a foreign language.

### Backend
</div>

- Java: My main weapon of choice for building APIs. Strong, versatile, and sometimes makes me question my life decisions with all those semicolons and curly braces.

- Python: I know the basics for API creation. Python is like the friend who’s always chill—gets the job done with fewer lines of code and somehow makes it all look effortless. But let’s be real: I mostly use it when Java gives me a headache.

- Postgres: My trusty main database. It’s like the reliable friend who always has your back with ACID compliance and complex queries. SQL never tasted so good.

- MongoDB: Used occasionally, like a sidekick that doesn’t always follow the rules (NoSQL, am I right?). Sometimes, you just need that flexible, schema-free vibe.

### What I am learning and what I learned in Software Engineering:
</div>

- Design Patterns: You know, those reusable solutions to common problems that make you feel like a coding Jedi. May the Singleton be with you. Except when it’s not the best idea (I’m looking at you, multithreading).

- cClean Code: Writing code so clean that even Robert Martin would approve. “Does this variable name spark joy? If not, refactor it.”

- Agile Methodologies: Moving fast, breaking things, and then fixing them in the next sprint. The daily standup is basically a 15-minute exercise in making yourself sound more productive than you actually are.

- Version Control (Git): Learning how to manage the timeline of my code’s life… or undo the chaos when I inevitably break something. Git push is great; git revert is like going back in time to fix all my mistakes—both in code and in life.

- Unit Testing: Writing tests for my code so I can catch bugs before they catch me. Testing is like flossing — everyone knows we should do it, but we all tend to skip it… until disaster strikes.

- Microservices architecture: Because who doesn’t like splitting up a monolith and then spending the rest of their life debugging interactions between tiny services that refuse to play nice with each other like my relationship with my family?

- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD): Automating everything so I can just push a button and deploy code like a magician. The real trick is pretending everything works perfectly the first time — spoiler: it never does, and you’ll have to do it all over again.
